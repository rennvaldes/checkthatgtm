          <p>

In response to Customer&apos;s reasonable objection, the parties will work together in good faith to determine an appropriate resolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            GrowthX will impose on its Subprocessors substantially the same obligations that apply to GrowthX under this DPA. GrowthX will be liable to Customer for any breaches of this DPA caused by its Subprocessors&apos; acts and omissions as it would be for its own.

          <p>
            Customer instructs GrowthX to delete Customer Personal Data within 90 days of the termination of the Agreement and delete existing copies unless applicable law requires otherwise. The parties agree that the certification of deletion described in Clause 8.5 of the EU SCCs and Clause 12 of the UK SCCs, if applicable, shall be provided only upon Customer&apos;s written request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GrowthX may retain Customer Personal Data to the extent and for the period required by applicable laws and compliance with GrowthX&apos;s retention policies provided that GrowthX maintains the confidentiality of all such Customer Personal Data and Processes such Customer Personal Data only as necessary for the purpose(s) specified in the applicable laws requiring its storage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. Audits</h3>

        <div className="ml-6 space-y-4">
          <p>
            To the extent required of GrowthX under Data Protection Laws governing GrowthX&apos;s processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer may audit GrowthX&apos;s compliance with its obligations under this DPA up to once per year. In addition, Customer may perform more frequent audits in the event: (1) GrowthX suffers a Security Incident affecting Customer Personal Data; (2) Customer has genuine, documented concerns regarding GrowthX&apos;s compliance with this DPA or the Data Protection Laws; or (3) where required by the Data Protection Laws, including where mandated by regulatory or governmental authorities with jurisdiction over Customer Personal Data. GrowthX will contribute to such audits by providing Customer or Customer&apos;s regulatory or governmental authority with the information and assistance reasonably necessary to conduct the audit, including any relevant records of Processing activities applicable to the Service, as described below.
          </p>

          <p>
            To request an audit, Customer must submit a detailed proposed audit plan to privacy@growthx.ai at least one month in advance of the proposed audit start date. The proposed audit plan must describe the proposed scope, duration, start date of the audit, and the identity of any third party Customer intends to appoint to perform the audit. GrowthX will review the proposed audit plan and provide Customer with any concerns or questions (for example, GrowthX may object to the third party auditor as described in Section 10.3, provide an Audit Report as described in Section 10.4, or identify any requests for information that could compromise GrowthX confidentiality obligations or security, privacy, employment or other relevant policies). The parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on a final audit plan at least 30 days in advance of the proposed audit start date. Nothing in this Section 10 shall require GrowthX to breach any duties of confidentiality.
          </p>

          <p>
            GrowthX may object to third party auditors that are, in GrowthX&apos;s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of GrowthX, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Customer will appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself if the parties cannot resolve the objection after negotiating in good faith.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the requested audit scope is addressed in an SOC 2, ISO, NIST or similar audit report performed by a qualified third party auditor on GrowthX&apos;s systems that Process Customer Personal Data (&quot;Audit Reports&quot;) within twelve (12) months of Customer&apos;s audit request and GrowthX confirms there are no known material changes in the controls audited, Customer agrees to accept the Audit Report in lieu of requesting an audit of the controls covered by the Audit Report.
          </p>

          <p>
            The audit must be conducted at a mutually agreeable time during regular business hours at the applicable business facility, subject to the agreed final audit plan and GrowthX&apos;s health and safety or other relevant policies and may not unreasonably interfere with GrowthX business activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any audits are at Customer&apos;s expense and Customer will promptly disclose to GrowthX any perceived non-compliance or security concerns discovered during the audit, together with all relevant details.
          </p>

          <p>
            The parties agree that the audits described in Clause 8.9 of the EU SCCs and Clause 5(f) of the UK SCCs, if applicable, shall be performed in accordance with this Section 10.
          </p>

        <div className="ml-6 space-y-4">
          <p>
            Customer acknowledges and agrees that GrowthX may create and derive from Processing related to the Service anonymized and/or aggregated data that does not identify or relate to Customer or any Data Subject (&quot;Analytics Data&quot;), and use, publicize or share with third parties such Analytics Data to improve the Service and for GrowthX&apos;s other legitimate business purposes in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

          <p>
            Customer acknowledges that GrowthX is reliant on Customer for direction as to the extent to which GrowthX is entitled to Process Customer Personal Data on behalf of Customer in performance of the Service. Consequently, GrowthX will not be liable under the Agreement for any claim brought by a Data Subject arising from (a) any action or omission by GrowthX in compliance with Customer&apos;s instructions or (b) from Customer&apos;s failure to comply with its obligations under the Data Protection Laws.
          </p>

        <div className="ml-6 space-y-4">
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Cookies</strong> are text files that websites store on a visitor&apos;s device to uniquely identify the visitor&apos;s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, engaging in advertising, and helping us understand activity and patterns.</li>

            <li><strong>Local storage technologies,</strong> like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.</li>

            <li><strong>Web beacons,</strong> also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We may use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Persistent cookies stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them, while session cookies are deleted once you close your web browser. The cookies placed through your use of our website are either set by us (first-party cookies) or by a third party at our request (third-party cookies).
          </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. What types of cookies do we use?</h3>

        <div className="ml-6 space-y-4">
          <p>We use the following categories of cookies:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Essential.</strong> We use essential cookies to help make our website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but then some or all parts of the websites will not work.</li>

            <li><strong>Functionality / performance.</strong> We use these cookies to enhance the functionality and performance of the services.</li>

            <li><strong>Analytics.</strong> These cookies help us understand how you interact with our websites by providing information such as the pages visited, the time spent on the websites, and any issues encountered, such as error messages. The information these cookies collect are for the purposes of generating aggregated statistics and they help us improve the way our websites work. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before placing Analytics Cookies on your device.</li>

            <li><strong>Advertising/targeting cookies:</strong> We and our third-party advertising partners use these cookies to collect information about how you use our website and use that information to serve online ads that may be relevant to your interests. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. Additionally, they enable features like content sharing and social plug-ins from social networking platforms, which may also use the data collected to serve targeted advertisements.</li>

            <li><strong>Email Interaction Technology:</strong> Our emails may contain web beacons to tell us whether they are opened and verify any clicks through to links within an email. We (and our marketing service provider on our behalf) use this information to help us understand how an email campaign performed, what types of emails and content our recipients find interesting, and what actions our recipients took, so we can improve our email campaigns in the future and make our emails more relevant to our recipients. If you do not wish the web beacon to be downloaded onto your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Depending on where you access the services from, you may be presented with a cookie banner or other tool to provide permissions prior to non-Essential cookies being set. In this case, we only set these non-Essential cookies with your consent.

          <p>
            You can also limit online tracking by blocking cookies in your browser. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.
